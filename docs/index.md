Going through the grocery store, as we add stuff to our cart, we're trying to keep a total in our head or on paper maybe even in our calculator.

But then we get to the register and we forgot to add taxes, or we miscounted, or we forgot what taxes actually were in our area, and the price of the detergent went up by 30 cents since our last trip. Now, our whole budget is off!

So I decided to look and see: was there an app or service that would allow me to keep a running total of what I put in my cart as I was shopping?

I could skip the anxiety when I got to the register!


But Walmart, Target, any of the other big box app stores: all you can do is look up an item. As soon as you scan the next one, the other one disappears! And you're left to keeping a total in your head or on paper.



Enter: Reggi.
